# RNFT-RelationNFTs
RNFTs are a new version of NFTs that are relational

## How Do They Work

They require NFTs to sign messages or related nfts and uses Web of Trust to recognize relationships between NFTs. For example, if my NFT is related to something like `x`, I can sign `x` and `x` can choose whether they decide to sign back.
